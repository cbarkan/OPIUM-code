4 coeff pseudocode:

1. Pick starting point

while error is improving:
    Given starting point..
    2. Line minimize along -1*gradient direction
        -The resulting point will be in valley space, call the point r1
    3. Pick 3 nearby points and line minimize, call the resulting points r2,r3,r4
    4. Find "difference vecotrs r'2 r'3 r'4 where r'i = ri - r1
    5. Check lengths and linear independence of r'2 r'3 r'4
        - while (length of r'i is too small) or (r'i is in span{r'(j != i)}):
            pick new point near r1 and line-minimize to find new ri and r'i
    6. orthonormalize r'2 r'3 r'4 to get o.n. basis {v1,v2,v3} of valley space
    7. Minimize error through valley space
    8. New starting point is result of valley space minimization
